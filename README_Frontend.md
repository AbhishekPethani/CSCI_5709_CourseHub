### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this assingnment up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software

```
Node JS
```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Step-1: Download Node.js Installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Step-2: Once the installer finishes downloading, launch it and install it.
Step-3: To verify installation, Open a command prompt and enter the command node -v and you should get node version.
Step-4: Download this project. open command prompt and navigate to this project directory.
Step-5: Run the the following commands. The npm install command will download all the dependencies and npm start will create and start deployment server on port 3000 and our application is now accessible on browser.

    npm start
step-6: Open any browser and type localhost:3000 
```

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The web framework used to develop front end components of this application.
* [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - This library is used to handle different navigation routes.
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/) - This framework is used to design react components.

## My Work

### Feature (CourseReview)
```
In this project, I have worked on Course review feature. A task of this features are as follow:
1. Add rating
2. Add Review
3. Delete Review
```

### Files (CourseReview)
```
The files which i have created as a part of this features are as follow:
1. NavbarComp.js    		(available at: src/components/)
2. ReviewSection.js 		(available at: src/components/CourseReview/)
3. Review.js        		(available at: src/components/CourseReview/)
4. ReviewModal.js   		(available at: src/components/CourseReview/)
5. DeleteReviewDialog.js	(available at: src/components/CourseReview/)
6. reviews.js        		(available at: src/services/)	
```

### Feature Test (CourseReview)
```
Step-1: In order to see the functionality of the CourseReview feature, first logged into the system by either creating a new account or use test user credential (email: course_review_test@gmail.com password: CourseReviewTest).
Step-2: After logged into the system you will see home page with multiple courses.
Step-3: Open any course for which you want to see the review.
Step-4: You will be redirect to course page and all you need to do is scroll down.
Step-5: If you see message "No reviews available for this course." that means there is no review given to that course.
Step-6: You can add a review by clicking a Add Review button available on right side.
Step-7: If you cannot see the Add Review button that means you have not purchased that course and hence you cannot write a review. (if you have used test user credential, then you can see the Add Review button in "Angular" course only)
Step-8: You will see a Modal in which you can select stars out of five and give review description. After adding review just submit it. It will be shown in the UI.
Step-9: You can delete only those review which you have given earlier. The Delete icon will be shown on the right side of the Review area for all the review that you have given earlier.
Step-10: Click on delete icon and you will be prompted to confirm whether to delete a review or not. Clicking on Yes will removed the review and by clicking on No will not remove a review. 
```

- The code in [React Grid component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/grid/) was implemented by using react-mui library. This code provides grid layout with multiple material UI components to build complex layout.
- [React Grid component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/grid/)'s Code was used because it provides design that i can use to display review given by user. This complex grid contains Img component that i can directly use to display user's profile. It also contains various Grid component which i can utilise to display user name, review dscription along with given rating and to show delete icon to delete the review.   
- [React Grid component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/grid/)'s Code was modified by adding FaStar icons to display raings, by adding DeleteIcon to only those reviews that the current logged in user has wrote previously. Also, i have passed various props such as, review which contains review details (username, review description, and star ratings), currentUser to display DeleteIcons for reviews written by this current user, setReviewToDelete to set which review to delete when currentUser clicked on DeleteIcons button, and setIsDeleteIconClicked to set isDeleteIconClicked state when current user clicked on DeleteIcons.

### ReviewModal.js

*Lines 35 - 44*

```
const useDidMountEffect = (func, deps) => {
  const didMount = useRef(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (didMount.current) {
      func();
    } else {
      didMount.current = true;
    }
  }, deps);
};
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [How to Make the React useEffect Hook Not Run on Initial Render?](https://thewebdev.info/2021/03/13/how-to-make-the-react-useeffect-hook-not-run-on-initial-render/). This code used as it is.

- [How to Make the React useEffect Hook Not Run on Initial Render?](https://thewebdev.info/2021/03/13/how-to-make-the-react-useeffect-hook-not-run-on-initial-render/)'s Code was used to prevent useEffect hook to run on initial render of ReviewModal component. I have created error handling code which displays errors on ReviewModal when there is change in erros state using useEffect hook. But useEffect hook displays errors on first render (there is no error when ReviewModal component renders for the first time). So in order to disable useEffect hook to display errors on first render, above code is used.  

*Lines 78 - 104*

            </Typography>
        </Box>
    </Fade>
</Modal>
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [React Modal component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/modal/) as shown below: 

```
<div>
    <Button onClick={handleOpen}>Open modal</Button>
    <Modal
        aria-labelledby="transition-modal-title"
        aria-describedby="transition-modal-description"

        onClose={handleClose}
        closeAfterTransition
        BackdropComponent={Backdrop}
        BackdropProps={{

        </Fade>
    </Modal>    
</div>
```

- The code in [React Modal component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/modal/) was implemented by using react-mui library. This code provides modal to display details. When user click on button, this modal will be shown as pop-up.
- [React Modal component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/modal/)'s Code was used because it provides a popover box which gives focused UI so that user can only focus on writing review. Using such design disable interaction with other section and disable scrolling of the page until the modal is open. 
- [React Modal component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/modal/)'s Code was modified by replacing the text inside Typography component with Rating component for star rating, TextField component for review description and Button component to submit the review. I have added error handling functionality to check if the user has selected stars and wrote review in the text field and based on that appropriate errors will be displayed when the user clicked on submit button.

### DeleteReviewDialog.js

*Lines 34 - 47*

```
<Dialog open={isDeleteIconClicked} onClose={() => setIsDeleteIconClicked(false)}

        <Button onClick={handleClick} value="No" autoFocus>No</Button>

The code above was created by adapting the code in [React Dialog component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/dialogs/) as shown below: 

```

    <DialogContent>
        <DialogContentText>
            Let Google help apps determine location. This means sending anonymous

```

- The code in [React Dialog component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/dialogs/) was implemented by using react-mui library. 
- [React Dialog component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/dialogs/)'s Code was used because it provides Dialogs(a type of modal) to inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until user confirmed or dismissed required action.
- [React Dialog component - MUI](https://mui.com/components/dialogs/)'s Code was modified by DialogActions. I have changed buttons in DialogActions and added handleClick function on onClick event. This handleClick function will set which button is clicked. Based on this event, review either will be deleted if user clicked Yes button or remains as it is if user clicked No button.
